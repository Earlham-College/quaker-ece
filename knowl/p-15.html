<div class="para">In this chapter, we shall discuss physics and its role in <dfn class="terminology">quantum computing</dfn> . It will be particularly relevant for people who think the study of physics and mathematics is nothing more than a list of equations to memorize for any undergraduate student enrolled in sciences. This is untrue. Science evolves every day and the job of a scientist is to synthesize their knowledge to face problems and find solutions. Since physics is relevant to many different domains in science, it is a multifaceted subject that is highly important to study.</div>
