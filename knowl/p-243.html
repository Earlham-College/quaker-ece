<div class="para">In general, algorithms are step-by-step procedures that take an input, process it through a series of well-defined steps, and produce an output. They are the backbone of problem-solving in computing, enabling machines to perform tasks efficiently and systematically. Quantum computing introduces a new paradigm in algorithm design, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers. Two of the most prominent quantum algorithms are Grover’s algorithm and Shor’s algorithm, each demonstrating the transformative potential of quantum computing.</div>

<div class="para">With the circuit in the fig. 2.3.3, we can simulate a non-reversible gate, besides, we keep a copy of the inputs and add of the <span class="process-math">\(x_0∧x_1\)</span> operation, after it adds previous result to <span class="process-math">\(x_2\text{.}\)</span> We fix <span class="process-math">\(x_2 = 0\)</span> and obtain a non-reversible AND gate. Where <span class="process-math">\(\oplus\)</span> represents the logical exclusive-OR operation, which it is the same addition modulo two. Then, we can obtain a reversible version of the circuit if we replace the irreversible parts with their reversible counterparts.</div>
