<div class="para">The security behind our modern cryptographic methods lies in the fact that it is very computationally difficult to find the prime factors of large numbers. It takes years of computing time on a classical computer to find the factors of numbers with hundreds of digits. The algorithm designed by Peter Shor takes advantage of quantum concepts to find the prime factors of large numbers much quicker. If a powerful enough quantum computer is ever built it could be used to break most modern encryptions jarringly quickly. Before describing the algorithm, we must first define some terms.</div>

<div class="para">In the field of cryptography, quantum computers could be used to improve the security of our information systems. However, quantum computations can also be used to break through our modern crypto-systems much faster than is possible through classical computing. One method through which quantum computation could be used to break through our modern cybersecurity is with an algorithm created by American mathematician Peter Shor in 1994.</div>
