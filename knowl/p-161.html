<div class="para">The tensor product (represented by a <span class="process-math">\(\otimes\)</span> symbol) is an operation between two matrices (or vectors) that multiplies each entry in the matrix on the left by the matrix on the right. Thus the tensor product between a <span class="process-math">\(m\times n\)</span> matrix and a <span class="process-math">\(p \times q\)</span> matrix will be a <span class="process-math">\(mp \times nq \text{,}\)</span> as shown below.</div>

<div class="para">Any system of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> qubits will have <span class="process-math">\(2^n\)</span> basis states. As we have seen already, in a one-qubit system, the two basis states are <span class="process-math">\(\ket{0}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ket{1}\text{.}\)</span> In a two-qubit system, the four basis states are <span class="process-math">\(\ket{00}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ket{01}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ket{10}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ket{11}\text{.}\)</span> These four basis states each have vector representations, which are found by using the <dfn class="terminology">tensor product</dfn>
