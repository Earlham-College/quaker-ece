<div class="para">We now introduce the bra in Bra-Ket Notation. Each vector representation of a qubit has a corresponding <dfn class="terminology">bra</dfn> vector (sometimes also referred to as the "Dual Vector") that is equal to the complex conjugate of the transpose of the ket. This operation of taking the transpose and complex conjugating is known as the <dfn class="terminology">adjoint</dfn> and is represented by the <span class="process-math">\(\dagger\)</span> symbol. Bra vectors are represented by the symbol <span class="process-math">\(\bra{}\text{.}\)</span> An example of finding the bra vector for the ket <span class="process-math">\(\psi\)</span> is shown below (where the <span class="process-math">\(*\)</span> symbol represents complex conjugating).</div>

<div class="para">A hilbert space is a complex vector space in which the inner product is defined as an operation. A single qubit exists within the hilbert space <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{C}^2\text{,}\)</span> which is the set of all two dimensional vectors with complex entries.</div>
