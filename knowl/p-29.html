<div class="para">The three laws of motion can be seen in the example of a rocket launching into space. As the thrusters begin to fire, the rocket does not immediately begin to move. Since the rocket begins at rest, its inertial properties resist changing to a state of motion, which showcases the first law. Once the rocket begins to lift off the ground, it appears to be moving upwards slowly. Since the rocket is very heavy, it has a lot of mass, and since acceleration is inversely proportional to mass by Newtonâ€™s second law, it thus accelerates slowly. The third law of motion can be seen in the fact that the rocket engines are pushing down, which causes the equal and opposite reaction of the rocket to move upwards.</div>
