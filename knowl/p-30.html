<div class="para">When describing the state of a qubit, instead of writing 0 and 1, we use <span class="process-math">\(\ket{0}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ket{1}\text{.}\)</span> These quantum states belong to a <dfn class="terminology">vector space</dfn>, which means that multiplying states by a constant coefficient and adding states together will result in another valid quantum state. This is how a superposition is formed, by creating a linear combination of the states <span class="process-math">\(\ket{0}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ket{1}\text{.}\)</span>

=======
<div class="para">Before diving into the basics of quantum computing, we must first discuss how computing is done classically. On non-quantum computers, information is stored in strings of bits, where each bit is either a 0 or a 1. These strings of bits represent numbers in binary and they provide computers with instructions on what to do. The notable difference on a quantum computer is that quantum bits (qubits) exist in a <dfn class="terminology">superposition</dfn> of states that allows them to be both a 0 and a 1 until they are measured and this superposition collapses. This unique property of qubits allows quantum computers to perform multiple processes simultaneously.</div>
