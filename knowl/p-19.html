<div class="para">Electromagnetism, dealing with electric and magnetic fields and their interactions, began in the 18th century with static electricity and magnetism as separate phenomena. Benjamin Franklin’s experiments with lightning and Luigi Galvani’s work on bioelectricity were early milestones. The unification of electricity and magnetism into a single theory was achieved by James Clerk Maxwell in the mid-19th century, whose equations predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves, leading to Heinrich Hertz’s discovery of radio waves.</div>

<div class="para">In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler elucidated the principles of lenses and vision, while Galileo’s telescopic observations expanded our understanding of the cosmos. Isaac Newton’s corpuscular theory of light and Christian Huygens’ wave theory were significant milestones, reconciled in the 19th century by experiments demonstrating the wave nature of light.</div>
