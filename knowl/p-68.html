<em class="alert">Matrices:</em> Whereas a vector is a single column of elements, a <dfn class="terminology">matrix</dfn> is a table of elements organized in rows and columns. Technically speaking, a vector can be thought of a matrix with only one column. The dimension of a matrix is described by first listing the number of rows and then listing the number of columns. Thus, a <span class="process-math">\(2 \times 3\)</span> matrix (read "two by three") would have two rows and three columns. A <dfn class="terminology">square matrix</dfn> is any matrix with the same number of rows and columns. One of the most important matrices is the <dfn class="terminology">identity matrix</dfn>, a square matrix in which all of the entries along the diagonal are <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and all other entries are <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> Examples of the <span class="process-math">\(2\times2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(5\times5\)</span> identity matrices are shown below, which can be generalized to any <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix.</div>
