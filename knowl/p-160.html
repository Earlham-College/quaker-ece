<div class="para">Any system of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> qubits will have <span class="process-math">\(2^n\)</span> basis states. As we have seen already, in a one-qubit system, the two basis states are <span class="process-math">\(\ket{0}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ket{1}\text{.}\)</span> In a two-qubit system, the four basis states are <span class="process-math">\(\ket{00}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ket{01}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ket{10}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ket{11}\text{.}\)</span> These four basis states each have vector representations, which are found by using the <dfn class="terminology">tensor product</dfn>

<div class="para">Below is pictured a circuit diagram (which we will delve deeper into in <a href="sec3-chap2.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.3: Circuits">SectionÂ 2.3</a>) representing the action on a single Qbit of the 1-Qbit gate <span class="process-math">\(U\text{.}\)</span> Initially the Qbit is described by the input state <span class="process-math">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span> on the left of the line. The line (wire) represents the subsequent operation on the Qbit. After emerging from the box representing the operator <span class="process-math">\(U\text{,}\)</span> the Qbit is described by the final state <span class="process-math">\(U \ket{\psi}.\)</span>
