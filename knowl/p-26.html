<div class="para">The second law of motion is often abbreviated by the equation <span class="process-math">\(\sum \vec{F} = m\vec{a}. \)</span> This equation tells us that the acceleration (<span class="process-math">\(\vec{a}\)</span>) of an object is directly proportional to the net force (<span class="process-math">\(\sum \vec{F}\)</span>) acting upon it and is inversely proportional to the mass (<span class="process-math">\(m\)</span>) of the object. Mass can be thought of as a numerical measure of inertia, so the second law relates to the first law in that objects with a lot of mass, i.e. objects with a lot of inertia, require greater forces to accelerate. Furthermore, if we look at the case where there are no forces acting upon an object, i.e. <span class="process-math">\(\sum \vec{F}=0\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(m\vec{a}=0\)</span> as well. Since the mass of an object can never be <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> when there are no forces acting upon an object, it must have an acceleration of <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> In the absence of acceleration, an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will continue to travel at a constant speed.</div>

<div class="para">Newtonâ€™s first law, put simply, is that in the absence of external forces, an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion. Furthermore, without outside interference, an object in motion will travel at a constant speed in a straight line. In Principia, Newton defines inertia as the property of matter to preserve its current state and resist attempts to change it.  Thus, the first law of motion establishes that all objects have the property of inertia and resist changes to their state of rest or motion.</div>
