<div class="para">Newtonâ€™s third law states that when two objects interact, the force exerted by the first object on the second is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted by the second object on the first. Simply put, every action has an equal and opposite reaction.</div>
=======
<div class="para">The second law of motion is often abbreviated by the equation <span class="process-math">\(\sum \vec{F} = m\vec{a}. \)</span> This equation tells us that the acceleration (<span class="process-math">\(\vec{a}\)</span>) of an object is directly proportional to the net force (<span class="process-math">\(\sum \vec{F}\)</span>) acting upon it and is inversely proportional to the mass (<span class="process-math">\(m\)</span>) of the object. Mass can be thought of as a numerical measure of inertia, so the second law relates to the first law in that objects with a lot of mass, i.e. objects with a lot of inertia, require greater forces to accelerate. Furthermore, if we look at the case where there are no forces acting upon an object, i.e. <span class="process-math">\(\sum \vec{F}=0\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(m\vec{a}=0\)</span> as well. Since the mass of an object can never be <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> when there are no forces acting upon an object, it must have an acceleration of <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> In the absence of acceleration, an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will continue to travel at a constant speed.</div>
