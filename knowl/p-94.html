<div class="para">Since all qubits are normalized, <span class="process-math">\(\psi\)</span> has a length of <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{\alpha^2 + \beta^2}=1\text{,}\)</span> which means <span class="process-math">\(\alpha^2 + \beta^2=1\text{.}\)</span>  Since the combined probability that the qubit will be in the state <span class="process-math">\(\ket{0}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\ket{1}\)</span> is equal to <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> we use the normal property of qubits as a method to determine the probability that the qubit will be in either state. For the qubit <span class="process-math">\(\psi\)</span> the probability that it will be in the state <span class="process-math">\(\ket{0}\)</span> after it is measured is <span class="process-math">\(\alpha^2\)</span> and the probability that it will be in the state <span class="process-math">\(\ket{1}\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\beta^2\text{.}\)</span>
=======
<div class="para">When a qubit is measured, it collapses from being a superposition of the states <span class="process-math">\(\ket{0}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ket{1}\)</span> to being in one state or the other. The probability that the qubit will be in either state is related to the coefficient on that state. Consider a qubit <span class="process-math">\(\psi \text{,}\)</span>
