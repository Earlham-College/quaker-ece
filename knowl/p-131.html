<div class="para">Recall from <a href="Qubit-States.html#subsec-Bra-Vectors-and-the-Inner-Product" class="internal" title="Subsection 1.7.3: Bra Vectors and the Inner Product for Quantum Computation">Subsection 1.7.3</a> that the adjoint operation represented by the <span class="process-math">\(\dagger\)</span> symbol consisted of transposing and complex conjugating a vector. This same operation can be performed on an operator (note that operations and operators are two different things). An operator <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is <dfn class="terminology">Hermitian</dfn> (also referred to as adjoin) if it satisfies the following property:</div>

<div class="para">Consider that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is not a scalar, but rather an operator maps between vector spaces, which means that these equations do not just represent basic multiplication. In quantum theory, operators can be represented by matrices, and tools like matrix multiplication and matrix addition (see <a href="Vectors-and-Vector-Spaces.html#linear-algebra" class="internal" title="Subsection 1.5.4: Linear Algebra">Subsection 1.5.4</a>) can be used to perform operations on qubits.</div>
