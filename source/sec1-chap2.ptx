  <title>Introduction</title>

  <p> 
    In the preceding chapter, we laid the groundwork for understanding quantum computing by exploring its fundamental principles and mathematical foundations. With a solid grasp of these basics, we now turn our attention to the essential building blocks of quantum computation: quantum gates and circuits. Quantum gates, akin to classical logic gates, are the fundamental operations that manipulate quantum bits (qubits). These gates perform specific transformations on qubits, enabling the execution of complex quantum algorithms. Unlike their classical counterparts, quantum gates leverage the principles of superposition and entanglement, allowing for a more powerful and intricate means of information processing.

    In this chapter, we will delve into the structure and function of various quantum gates. We will start with single-qubit gates, such as the Pauli gates, the Hadamard gate, and the phase gate, which illustrate how individual qubits can be rotated and transformed. Following this, we will explore multi-qubit gates, including the Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate and the SWAP gate, which highlight the interactions between qubits and the entanglement that underpins quantum parallelism. Understanding these gates is crucial, as they form the basis for constructing quantum circuits. A quantum circuit, composed of a sequence of quantum gates, represents a quantum algorithm or computation. By learning how to design and analyze these circuits, we gain insight into how quantum information is processed and manipulated to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers.
