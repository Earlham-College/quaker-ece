<biography xml:id="author-bio-TWJ">
  <p>Dr. Javier Orduz holds the distinguished position of 
    Visiting Assistant Professor at Earlham College and 
    also serves as an Instructor at Baylor University. 
    In his academic course, he embodies an all-rounder 
    that rests on technological expertise with an edge 
    of ambition. Displays of such versatility are 
    echoed in his research, publishing works, teaching 
    style, and foray into deeper areas carried out among 
    friends who share similar interests. A Research Scholar 
    and instructor of Computer Science, he first began his 
    journey at Baylor University in Texas. He moved on from 
    these deep roots to spend more than five years as a 
    postdoctoral scholar and assistant professor of computer 
    science and applied math at the 
    Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM). 
  </p>
  <p>
    The impact of Dr. Orduz does not stop in the walls 
    academia And his commitment to the massive potential 
    of quantum computing in Latin America is evident by being 
    at the frontend as the coordinator at 
    <url href="https://qmexico.org/" visual="QMexico." target ="_blank"/>
    He has been 
    unstoppable in driving forward the efforts to bring 
    quantum computing education and research into this 
    vibrant educational ecosystem. As a Research Scientist 
    he tackles forays into quantum machine learning and 
    prepares the future of this 
    field with creative algorithmic solutions. With his 
    mentorship, Dr. Orduz is also dedicated to the 
    <url href="https://www.latinxinai.org/" visual="LatinX AI" target ="_blank"/>
    community by mentoring and fostering 
    (in multiple ways) the representation of underrepresented 
    cohorts in AI.
