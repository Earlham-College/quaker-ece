  <title>Introduction</title>

  <p> The word <i>quantum</i> is one that requires particular attention. This word can be used to garner interest, explain physical phenomena, or even just to confuse people. But for physicists, quantum means revolution.</p>
<p>
    This revolution was born in the early 19th century. New discoveries in physics could not be explained within the classical scientific theories of the time. Scientists needed new ideas to explain atomic and subatomic phenomena.

    In the context of quantum computation, the word quantum was coined by theoretical physicist Max Planck during his study of black-body radiation when he proposed the idea that energy was not continuously emitted, but was instead emitted and absorbed in discrete "quanta" (a word meaning "how much"). This theory allowed him to produce equations that closely matched the observed phenomena around him, solving a problem that physicists had been struggling with for decades. Planck's contributions to science changed our conception of the universe and caused scientists to rethink some of our most fundamental theories. Today, this revolution continues as we discover new advances in the realms of quantum mechanics and quantum computation. Like the scientists of the past, we must question what we know about the world around us to bring this revolution forward into its next steps.

    This document contains information about the basics on Quantum Computing. Some concepts require time, in depth analysis, and even the ability to accept counter intuitive ideas.
