  <title>Introduction</title>

  <p> 
    In general, algorithms are step-by-step procedures that take an input, process it through a series of well-defined steps, and produce an output. They are the backbone of problem-solving in computing, enabling machines to perform tasks efficiently and systematically. Quantum computing introduces a new paradigm in algorithm design, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers. Two of the most prominent quantum algorithms are Grover's algorithm and Shor's algorithm, each demonstrating the transformative potential of quantum computing.

    Grover's algorithm, developed by Lov Grover in 1996, provides a quadratic speedup for unsorted database searches. In classical computing, searching an unsorted database of <m>N</m> items requires <m>O(N)</m>  time, whereas Grover's algorithm can achieve this in <m>O(\sqrt{N})</m> time. This is achieved by exploiting the principles of superposition and amplitude amplification, allowing the quantum computer to evaluate multiple possibilities simultaneously. Grover's algorithm has broad implications for fields requiring extensive search capabilities, such as cryptography and database management.

    Shor's algorithm, proposed by Peter Shor in 1994, addresses the problem of integer factorization, which underpins the security of many classical cryptographic systems, such as RSA. Classical algorithms for factoring large integers are inefficient, making RSA encryption secure under current classical computing capabilities. However, Shor's algorithm can factorize large integers exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms, in polynomial time. This breakthrough poses a significant threat to current cryptographic practices, necessitating the development of quantum-resistant encryption methods.

    Algorithms are fundamental to computing, guiding processes and solving problems efficiently. Quantum algorithms harness the unique properties of quantum mechanics to tackle challenges beyond the reach of classical algorithms. These developments not only demonstrate the power of quantum computing but also herald a new era of computational possibilities, revolutionizing fields from cryptography to data search. In this chapter, we will discuss the basic concepts and process of Grover's and Shor's algorithms.
