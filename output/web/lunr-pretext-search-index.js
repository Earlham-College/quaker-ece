  "body": " Introduction  The word quantum is one that requires particular attention. This word can be used to garner interest, explain physical phenomena, or even just to confuse people. But for physicists, quantum means revolution.  This revolution was born in the early 19th century. New discoveries in physics could not be explained within the classical scientific theories of the time. Scientists needed new ideas to explain atomic and subatomic phenomena.  In the context of quantum computation, the word quantum was coined by theoretical physicist Max Planck during his study of black-body radiation when he proposed the idea that energy was not continuously emitted, but was instead emitted and absorbed in discrete \"quanta\" (a word meaning \"how much\"). This theory allowed him to produce equations that closely matched the observed phenomena around him, solving a problem that physicists had been struggling with for decades. Planck's contributions to science changed our conception of the universe and caused scientists to rethink some of our most fundamental theories. Today, this revolution continues as we discover new advances in the realms of quantum mechanics and quantum computation. Like the scientists of the past, we must question what we know about the world around us to bring this revolution forward into its next steps.  This document contains information about the basics on Quantum Computing. Some concepts require time, in depth analysis, and even the ability to accept counterintuitive ideas.  "

  "body": " Introduction  In this chapter, we shall discuss physics and its role in quantum computing Quantum Quantum Computing . It will be particularly relevant for people who think the study of physics and mathematics is nothing more than a list of equations to memorize for any undergraduate student enrolled in sciences. This is untrue. Science evolves every day and the job of a scientist is to synthesize their knowledge to face problems and find solutions. Since physics is relevant to many different domains in science, it is a multifaceted subject that is highly important to study.  Physics is about motion, atoms, nuclei, elementary particles, heat, Thermodynamics, Electrodynamics, and Statistics, among other areas. These many different fields can be classified by their mathematical concepts, their chronological development, or even in terms of theoretical and experimental scientific points of view.  One of the most important branches of Physics studies interaction at tiny scale: Quantum Mechanics. This branch was revolutionized by Max Planck in the early 1900s, although many other scientists contributed to its development. The phenomena that Planck and other scientists observed at this tiny scale were at odds with the scientific \"rules\" established by Classical Physics. To resolve this issue, the field of Quantum Mechanics was born to provide an explanation for subatomic phenomena. This field established non-conventional concepts that have quickly spread throughout other realms of science. In the coming chapters we will discuss the mathematical foundations of Quantum Mechanics.  "

  "body": " Classical Physics  Classical physics, a cornerstone of scientific understanding, encompasses several branches that describe the physical phenomena of the universe, laying the groundwork for modern science. Optics, electromagnetism, nuclear physics, astrophysics, and thermodynamics are pivotal fields that have evolved through centuries of inquiry and discovery. Optics, the study of light and its interactions with matter, dates back to ancient civilizations. The Greeks, particularly Euclid and Ptolemy, made early contributions with theories on reflection and refraction.  In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler elucidated the principles of lenses and vision, while Galileo's telescopic observations expanded our understanding of the cosmos. Isaac Newton's corpuscular theory of light and Christian Huygens' wave theory were significant milestones, reconciled in the 19th century by experiments demonstrating the wave nature of light.  Electromagnetism, dealing with electric and magnetic fields and their interactions, began in the 18th century with static electricity and magnetism as separate phenomena. Benjamin Franklin's experiments with lightning and Luigi Galvani's work on bioelectricity were early milestones. The unification of electricity and magnetism into a single theory was achieved by James Clerk Maxwell in the mid-19th century, whose equations predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves, leading to Heinrich Hertz's discovery of radio waves.  Nuclear physics, focusing on atomic nuclei, emerged in the early 20th century, building on classical foundations. The discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel and the subsequent work of Marie and Pierre Curie opened new frontiers. Ernest Rutherford's gold foil experiment, which revealed the nucleus of an atom, was pivotal. Early developments in nuclear decay laws and the identification of radiation types owe much to classical methodologies.  Astrophysics, applying physics to celestial objects and phenomena, has ancient origins in observational astronomy. Early contributions by Hipparchus and Ptolemy laid the groundwork, but the Copernican Revolution in the 16th century and Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion advanced the field. Newton's law of universal gravitation unified terrestrial and celestial mechanics under a single theory, revealing that the force that moved the stars was the same one that held us to the ground: gravity.  Thermodynamics, the study of heat, work, and energy, emerged from the Industrial Revolution's practical needs. Sadi Carnot's work on steam engines laid the foundation for the field. The first and second laws of thermodynamics, formulated by Rudolf Clausius and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), established principles governing energy conservation and entropy, profoundly influencing scientific thought and engineering practice.  Classical physics is crucial academically as it forms the foundational bedrock upon which modern physics and other scientific disciplines are built. It introduces students to fundamental concepts such as Newtonian mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism, cultivating critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Mastery of classical physics fosters an appreciation for the scientific method and the historical context of discoveries, illustrating the interplay of theoretical advances and experimental validations. Serving as an indispensable educational foundation, classical physics equips students with the knowledge and skills necessary for careers in science, engineering, and technology, continuing to inspire future innovations and discoveries.

  "title": "Newtonian Mechanics",
  "body": " Newtonian Mechanics  Many of the concepts behind Classical Physics are motivated by Newtonian Mechanics, which is derived from Newton’s three laws of motion. These laws provide a framework for determining how an object will move when acted upon (or not acted upon) by external forces. Newton’s three laws were first described in his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica , which is widely considered to be one of the most important works in the history of physics \\cite{newton1850newton}.  Newton’s first law, put simply, is that in the absence of external forces, an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion. Furthermore, without outside interference, an object in motion will travel at a constant speed in a straight line. In Principia , Newton defines inertia as the property of matter to preserve its current state and resist attempts to change it \\cite{newton1850newton}. Thus, the first law of motion establishes that all objects have the property of inertia and resist changes to their state of rest or motion.  The second law of motion is often abbreviated by the equation This equation tells us that the acceleration ( ) of an object is directly proportional to the net force ( ) acting upon it and is inversely proportional to the mass ( ) of the object. Mass can be thought of as a numerical measure of inertia, so the second law relates to the first law in that objects with a lot of mass, i.e. objects with a lot of inertia, require greater forces to accelerate. Furthermore, if we look at the case where there are no forces acting upon an object, i.e. , we know that as well. Since the mass of an object can never be , when there are no forces acting upon an object, it must have an acceleration of . In the absence of acceleration, an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will continue to travel at a constant speed.  Newton’s third law states that when two objects interact, the force exerted by the first object on the second is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted by the second object on the first. Simply put, every action has an equal and opposite reaction.  The three laws of motion can be seen in the example of a rocket launching into space. As the thrusters begin to fire, the rocket does not immediately begin to move. Since the rocket begins at rest, its inertial properties resist changing to a state of motion, which showcases the first law. Once the rocket begins to lift off the ground, it appears to be moving upwards slowly. Since the rocket is very heavy, it has a lot of mass, and since acceleration is inversely proportional to mass by Newton’s second law, it thus accelerates slowly. The third law of motion can be seen in the fact that the rocket engines are pushing down, which causes the equal and opposite reaction of the rocket to move upwards.     "

On non-quantum computers, information is stored in strings of bits, where each bit is either a 0 or a 1. These strings of bits represent numbers in binary and they provide computers with instructions on what to do. The notable difference on a quantum computer is that quantum bits (qubits) exist in a superposition Superposition of states that allows them to be both a 0 and a 1 until they are measured and this superposition collapses. This unique property of qubits allows quantum computers to perform multiple processes simultaneously.  When describing the state of a qubit, instead of writing 0 and 1, we use and .

  "title": "Vectors and Vector Spaces",
  "body": " Vectors and Vector Spaces   Introduction to Vectors  A vector is an ordered list of numbers that is used to describe quantities with both magnitude and direction. One example of a vector is force, which has both a magnitude (how strong the force is) and a direction (the angle at which the force is being applied). Each vector has a dimension, which is the number of components that comprise it. It is customary to signify that something is a vector by either drawing an arrow on top of it or bolding it. If we have a vector called , we would write or . The number is called the -th component of .  The most typical use of a vector with components is to describe a point in dimensional space in reference to some starting point. For example, if you have a square piece of paper and label the bottom left corner with the starting point (0,0), then a vector with components (1,1) would represent moving one unit of measurement along the bottom of the paper and one unit of measurement along the side of the paper to reach a new point. This vector would have a direction of and a magnitude of units (by the pythagorean theorem).   An example of a vector     Vector Spaces  Every vector exists within a vector space Vector Vector Space , which are sets that satisfy certain mathematical properties. The most common vector spaces we will deal with are , the set of all dimensional vectors with real components, and , the set of all dimensional vectors with complex components. Notice , so we will usually work with for generality. All vector spaces have the same properties regardless of dimension. Here are the properties for an -dimensional vector space:  1. Vector equality: means   2. Vector addition: means   3. Scalar multiplication:   4. Negative of a vector:   5. Null vector: There exists a null vector   If our vector components are all real numbers (i.e. the vector space exists in instead of ), then the following properties also hold:  1. Addition of vectors is commutative:  2. Addition of vectors is associative:  3. Scalar multiplication is distributive: and  4. Scalar multiplication is associative:     Bases  For any vector space, one can find a subset of vectors which can be used to generate any other vector in the space through linear combinations (scalar multiplication and vector addition). The smallest set of vectors that fulfills this property is called the basis Vector basis . In , we only need two vectors to produce the rest through linear combination. The standard basis, is:   The ^ symbol is used to denote that a vector is normal Vector Normal , which means that it has a length of 1. The vector is referred to as \" hat.\" This property is extremely important to quantum mechanics and will be discussed more later.  Bases have two properties:   Linear Independence: A set of vectors is linearly independent Vector Linearly Independent if we cannot express any one of them as a linear combination of the others. If we can express one as a linear combination of the others, then it is called a linearly dependent Vector Linearly Dependent set. A basis must be linearly independent.   Completeness: A set of vectors is complete if it spans Vector Span its vector space, which in turn means that any vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in that set. A basis for a vector space must span the space.    (A Counterexample)  Let be the set,   And let be the vector,   Since we are unable to express as a linear combination of the elements of , then we say is not complete.    Let be the set,   And let be the vector,  We can express as:  Since we can express as a linear combination of the elements of and it is easy to show that we could construct any other vector in from these same elements, we say that spans and is complete.   Dimension of a basis. The number of basis elements for a vector space is the same as that spaces dimension.   Linear Algebra  Linear algebra is the study of vectors and transformations. In this subsection we will describe some other pieces of linear algebra that will be important to quantum computation.  Vector Transpose: The transpose Vector Transpose is an operation that turns a standard column vector into a row vector, or vice versa. This means an dimensional vector changes from having rows and column to having row and columns. The transpose is represented with a superscript and the operation is shown below.   Dot Product \/ Inner Product: The dot product (more generally known as the inner product Vector Inner Product in the context of quantum computation) is an operation between two vectors of the same dimension that produces a scalar. This product is typically referred to with a , but has an alternate notation in quantum computation that we will see in the next section. In and In this operation is performed by taking the sum of the products of the corresponding entries in each vector, as shown below.   Orthogonality:  Orthogonality Orthogonality is the generalization of the concept of perpendicularity. In two and three dimensional space, two vectors are orthogonal if the angle between them is a right angle. Two vectors are orthogonal if their inner product is equal to .  Normality: A vector is normal Vector Normal Vector if it has a length of . The length (sometimes also referred to as the norm) of a vector can be found be taking the square root of the sum of the squares of its entries, as shown below. A non-normal vector can be normalized by dividing each of its components by the vectors length. A set of vectors is orthonormal Vector Orthonormal Vectors if each of the vectors are normal and each of the vectors are orthogonal to the rest.   Matrices: Whereas a vector is a single column of elements, a matrix Matrix is a table of elements organized in rows and columns. Technically speaking, a vector can be thought of a matrix with only one column. The dimension of a matrix is described by first listing the number of rows and then listing the number of columns. Thus, a matrix (read \"two by three\") would have two rows and three columns. A square matrix Matrix Square Matrix is any matrix with the same number of rows and columns. One of the most important matrices is the identity matrix Matrix Identity Matrix , a square matrixin which all of the entries along the diagonal are and all other entries are . Examples of the and identity matrices are shown below, which can be generalized to any matrix.   A matrix can be multiplied by a scalar in the same way that a vector can, by multiplying each entry in the matrix by the scalar, as shown below.   The concept of a transpose can be extended from vectors to matrices as well. A matrix's transpose is found by turning each of its rows into a column, or, equivalently, by turning each of its columns into a row. This means the transpose of an matrix is an matrix. The matrix transpose is also represented by a superscript . An example of transposing a matrix is shown below.   Matrix Addition: Two matrices can be added together only if they each have the same number of rows and columns. The sum of two matrices is found by adding together the corresponding entries of each matrix, as shown below with an example of two matrices.    Compute the following sum:      Matrix Multiplication: Two matrices can be multiplied together only if the number of columns of the left matrix is equal to the number of rows of the right matrix. The resulting product will be a matrix with the same number of rows as the left matrix and the same number of columns as the right. Thus an matrix multiplied by a matrix would produce an matrix. Notably, matrix multiplication is non-commutative, which means for two matrices and , . The entries of a product matrix are determined by taking the dot product between the corresponding row of the left matrix and the corresponding column of the right matrix, as shown below with an example of multiplication between a and a matrix.   Now that we know matrix multiplication, we can redefine the dot product \/ inner product as the transpose of a vector multiplied by the original vector. Since vectors are dimensional, the transpose will be dimensional, so multiplying the transpose on the left and the original on the right will produce a matrix, which is functionally the same as a scalar.   Compute the following product:    The resulting matrix should be      "

With a solid grasp of these basics, we now turn our attention to the essential building blocks of quantum computation: quantum gates and circuits. Quantum gates, akin to classical logic gates, are the fundamental operations that manipulate quantum bits (qubits). These gates perform specific transformations on qubits, enabling the execution of complex quantum algorithms. Unlike their classical counterparts, quantum gates leverage the principles of superposition and entanglement, allowing for a more powerful and intricate means of information processing.  In this chapter, we will delve into the structure and function of various quantum gates. We will start with single-qubit gates, such as the Pauli gates, the Hadamard gate, and the phase gate, which illustrate how individual qubits can be rotated and transformed. Following this, we will explore multi-qubit gates, including the Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate and the SWAP gate, which highlight the interactions between qubits and the entanglement that underpins quantum parallelism. Understanding these gates is crucial, as they form the basis for constructing quantum circuits. A quantum circuit, composed of a sequence of quantum gates, represents a quantum algorithm or computation. By learning how to design and analyze these circuits, we gain insight into how quantum information is processed and manipulated to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers.

Understanding these gates is crucial, as they form the basis for constructing quantum circuits. A quantum circuit, composed of a sequence of quantum gates, represents a quantum algorithm or computation. By learning how to design and analyze these circuits, we gain insight into how quantum information is processed and manipulated to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers. In this chapter, our exploration will remain focused on the fundamental concepts, providing a clear and logical progression from the mathematical approach established in Chapter One. By the end of this chapter, you will have a foundational understanding of quantum gates and circuits, equipping you with the knowledge necessary to further explore the fascinating and complex world of quantum computing.
