<div class="para">The tensor product can also be applied to vector spaces. The tensor product of a vector that exists within a space <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and a vector that exists within a space <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> would exist within the space <span class="process-math">\(V \otimes W\text{.}\)</span> Thus, a system of two qubits would exist within the space <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{H} \otimes \mathcal{H}\)</span> and a system of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> qubits exists within the space <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{H}^{\otimes n}\text{,}\)</span> where the <span class="process-math">\(\otimes n\)</span> superscript means taking the tensor product of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{H}\)</span> with itself <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> times. Similarly, <span class="process-math">\(\ket{\psi}^{\otimes n}\)</span> would represent the state <span class="process-math">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span> tensored with itself <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> times. Suppose the space <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> dimensional the space <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> dimensional, then the vector space <span class="process-math">\(V \otimes W\)</span> would be <span class="process-math">\(n\cdot m\)</span> dimensional.</div>

<div class="para">In this chapter, our exploration will remain focused on the fundamental concepts, providing a clear and logical progression from the mathematical approach established in Chapter One. By the end of this chapter, you will have a foundational understanding of quantum gates and circuits, equipping you with the knowledge necessary to further explore the fascinating and complex world of quantum computing.</div>
