<div class="para">using the Euclidean Algorithm (we do not describe the Euclidean Algorithm in this webbook, but readers unfamiliar with it may be interested in this link <a class="external" href="https://tinyurl.com/4twaxsrf" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://tinyurl.com/4twaxsrf</code></a>). If we calculate that <span class="process-math">\(d=1\)</span> then we know that <span class="process-math">\(N | a^{r/2}+1\text{,}\)</span> which means we will not be able to factor <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> using this value of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and we will need to restart the algorithm with a new value of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> If we calculate that <span class="process-math">\(d\neq 1\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> is a factor of <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{N}{d}\)</span> is another factor. If either of these factors are not prime then we can perform the entire algorithm on them again in order to find their factors. We keep repeating this process until we can fully factor <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> and represent it as a product of primes.</div>
