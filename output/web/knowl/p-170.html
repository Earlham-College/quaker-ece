<div class="para">The tensor product is only one of many operations on qubits. In <a href="Vectors-and-Vector-Spaces.html#linear-algebra" class="internal" title="Subsection 1.5.4: Linear Algebra">Subsection 1.5.4</a> we described how the inner product could be represented as the product of a vector’s transpose and the vector. Since an <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> dimensional vector transpose is <span class="process-math">\(1\times n\)</span> and the vector is <span class="process-math">\(n\times1\text{,}\)</span> the resulting product is <span class="process-math">\(1\times1\text{,}\)</span> which is functionally equivalent to a scalar. If we were to reverse the order of the vector multiplication and multiply a column vector on the left and a row vector on the right, we would multiply an <span class="process-math">\(n\times1\)</span> vector by an <span class="process-math">\(1\times m\)</span> vector to produce an <span class="process-math">\(n\times m\)</span> matrix. More specifically, we want to multiply a vector on the left by the vectors adjoint (complex conjugated transpose) on the right. This operation is known as the <dfn class="terminology">outer product</dfn>. The outer product between two qubits <span class="process-math">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ket{\phi}\)</span> is shown below.</div>
