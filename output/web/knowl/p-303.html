=======
<div class="para">In 1994, while Peter Shor was working for Bell Labs, his proposed algorithm to quickly factor large numbers sent ripples across the fields of computer science, number theory, quantum computation, and cryptography. While it has not been proven that factoring large numbers can not be achieved on a classical computer in polynomial time, as of 2015 the fastest algorithm publicly available for factoring large number runs in</div>
