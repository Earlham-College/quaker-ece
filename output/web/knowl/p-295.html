<div class="para">Before fully diving into Shorâ€™s algorithm, we will have another example. Suppose we have two prime numbers, <span class="process-math">\(3, 7.\)</span> We can multiply them togehter to get <span class="process-math">\((3\times 7 = ) 21\)</span> which a positive number and the result of two prime numbers. Now, think about this</div>

<div class="para">Notice that after 4 values of <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> the function <span class="process-math">\(g_{229,247}(r)\)</span> begins to repeat itself. If we continued to write out this sequence as <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> continues to increase, we would find that every 4 integers, the sequence repeats again. This means that <span class="process-math">\(g_{229,247}(r)\)</span> has a period of 4, which means <span class="process-math">\(g_{229,247}(r) = g_{229,247}(r+4)\text{.}\)</span>
