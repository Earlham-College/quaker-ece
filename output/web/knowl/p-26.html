<div class="para">The second law of motion is often abbreviated by the equation <span class="process-math">\(\sum \vec{F} = m\vec{a}. \)</span> This equation tells us that the acceleration (<span class="process-math">\(\vec{a}\)</span>) of an object is directly proportional to the net force (<span class="process-math">\(\sum \vec{F}\)</span>) acting upon it and is inversely proportional to the mass (<span class="process-math">\(m\)</span>) of the object. Mass can be thought of as a numerical measure of inertia, so the second law relates to the first law in that objects with a lot of mass, i.e. objects with a lot of inertia, require greater forces to accelerate. Furthermore, if we look at the case where there are no forces acting upon an object, i.e. <span class="process-math">\(\sum \vec{F}=0\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(m\vec{a}=0\)</span> as well. Since the mass of an object can never be <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> when there are no forces acting upon an object, it must have an acceleration of <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> In the absence of acceleration, an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will continue to travel at a constant speed.</div>
