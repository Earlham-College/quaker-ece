<div class="para">Before diving into the basics of quantum computing, we must first discuss how computing is done classically. On non-quantum computers, information is stored in strings of bits, where each bit is either a 0 or a 1. These strings of bits represent numbers in binary and they provide computers with instructions on what to do. The notable difference on a quantum computer is that quantum bits (qubits) exist in a <dfn class="terminology">superposition</dfn> of states that allows them to be both a 0 and a 1 until they are measured and this superposition collapses. This unique property of qubits allows quantum computers to perform multiple processes simultaneously.</div>
