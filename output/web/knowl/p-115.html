<div class="para">One quirk of the Bloch sphere is that any two orthogonal state vectors (qubits) are represented on the sphere not as perpendicular, but as two vectors along the same line pointing in opposite directions. Thus the x-axis is defined by <span class="process-math">\(\ket{+}\)</span> in the positive direction and <span class="process-math">\(\ket{i}\)</span> in the negative direction, the y-axis is defined by <span class="process-math">\(\ket{+i}\)</span> in the positive and <span class="process-math">\(\ket{-i}\)</span> in the negative, and the z-axis is defined by <span class="process-math">\(\ket{0}\)</span> in the positive and <span class="process-math">\(\ket{1}\)</span> in the negative, hence the reason for the names of these states.</div>

<div class="para">The numbers <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> define a point on the three-dimensional unit sphere, which we will here call the <dfn class="terminology">Bloch sphere</dfn>. The Bloch sphere exists within a Hilbert Space, <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{H}\text{,}\)</span> and provides an intuitive method for depicting qubits as vectors and visualizing the operations we can perform on them.</div>
