<div class="para">Thermodynamics, the study of heat, work, and energy, emerged from the Industrial Revolution’s practical needs. Sadi Carnot’s work on steam engines laid the foundation for the field. The first and second laws of thermodynamics, formulated by Rudolf Clausius and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), established principles governing energy conservation and entropy, profoundly influencing scientific thought and engineering practice.</div>

<div class="para">Astrophysics, applying physics to celestial objects and phenomena, has ancient origins in observational astronomy. Early contributions by Hipparchus and Ptolemy laid the groundwork, but the Copernican Revolution in the 16th century and Johannes Kepler’s laws of planetary motion advanced the field. Newton’s law of universal gravitation unified terrestrial and celestial mechanics under a single theory, revealing that the force that moved the stars was the same one that held us to the ground: gravity.</div>
