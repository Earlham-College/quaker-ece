<div class="para">Electromagnetism, dealing with electric and magnetic fields and their interactions, began in the 18th century with static electricity and magnetism as separate phenomena. Benjamin Franklin’s experiments with lightning and Luigi Galvani’s work on bioelectricity were early milestones. The unification of electricity and magnetism into a single theory was achieved by James Clerk Maxwell in the mid-19th century, whose equations predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves, leading to Heinrich Hertz’s discovery of radio waves.</div>
