<div class="para">Shor’s algorithm, proposed by Peter Shor in 1994, addresses the problem of integer factorization, which underpins the security of many classical cryptographic systems, such as RSA. Classical algorithms for factoring large integers are inefficient, making RSA encryption secure under current classical computing capabilities. However, Shor’s algorithm can factorize large integers exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms, in polynomial time. This breakthrough poses a significant threat to current cryptographic practices, necessitating the development of quantum-resistant encryption methods.</div>

<div class="para">Grover’s algorithm, developed by Lov Grover in 1996, provides a quadratic speedup for unsorted database searches. In classical computing, searching an unsorted database of <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> items requires <span class="process-math">\(O(N)\)</span>  time, whereas Grover’s algorithm can achieve this in <span class="process-math">\(O(\sqrt{N})\)</span> time. This is achieved by exploiting the principles of superposition and amplitude amplification, allowing the quantum computer to evaluate multiple possibilities simultaneously. Grover’s algorithm has broad implications for fields requiring extensive search capabilities, such as cryptography and database management.</div>
