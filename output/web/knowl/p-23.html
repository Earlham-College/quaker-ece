<div class="para">Newtonâ€™s first law, put simply, is that in the absence of external forces, an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion. Furthermore, without outside interference, an object in motion will travel at a constant speed in a straight line. In Principia, Newton defines inertia as the property of matter to preserve its current state and resist attempts to change it.  Thus, the first law of motion establishes that all objects have the property of inertia and resist changes to their state of rest or motion.</div>
