<div class="para">The most typical use of a vector with <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> components is to describe a point in <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> dimensional space in reference to some starting point. For example, if you have a square piece of paper and label the bottom left corner with the starting point (0,0), then a vector with components (1,1) would represent moving one unit of measurement along the bottom of the paper and one unit of measurement along the side of the paper to reach a new point. This vector would have a direction of <span class="process-math">\(45^{\circ}\)</span> and a magnitude of <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> units (by the pythagorean theorem).</div>
=======
<div class="para">A vector is an ordered list of numbers that is used to describe quantities with both magnitude and direction. One example of a vector is force, which has both a magnitude (how strong the force is) and a direction (the angle at which the force is being applied). Each vector has a dimension, which is the number of components that comprise it. It is customary to signify that something is a vector by either drawing an arrow on top of it or bolding it. If we have a vector called <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> we would write <span class="process-math">\(\vec{x}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\boldsymbol{x}\text{.}\)</span> The number <span class="process-math">\(x_{n}\)</span> is called the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-th component of <span class="process-math">\(\vec{x}\text{.}\)</span>
