<div class="para">Systems with multiple qubits are described by vectors in higher dimensions, which will be discussed later.</div>
=======
<div class="para">This notation was first introduced by mathematician Paul Dirac and is known as "Dirac Notation" or "<dfn class="terminology">Bra-Ket Notation</dfn>." In this notation, the <span class="process-math">\(\ket{}\)</span> symbol represents a qubit state and is referred to as a "<dfn class="terminology">ket</dfn>." At a glance, it can be seen that the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\ket{0}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ket{1}\)</span> are each normal and are orthogonal to each other. Additionally, any point in two dimensional space could be described with a linear combination of these two vectors, meaning they form a basis (we will discuss exactly which space they form a basis for in the following section). Put together, this means <span class="process-math">\(\ket{0}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ket{1}\)</span> form an orthonormal basis. All qubits must be normalized in order to be expressed properly.</div>
