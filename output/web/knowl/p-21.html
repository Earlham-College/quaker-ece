<div class="para">Astrophysics, applying physics to celestial objects and phenomena, has ancient origins in observational astronomy. Early contributions by Hipparchus and Ptolemy laid the groundwork, but the Copernican Revolution in the 16th century and Johannes Kepler’s laws of planetary motion advanced the field. Newton’s law of universal gravitation unified terrestrial and celestial mechanics under a single theory, revealing that the force that moved the stars was the same one that held us to the ground: gravity.</div>

<div class="para">Nuclear physics, focusing on atomic nuclei, emerged in the early 20th century, building on classical foundations. The discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel and the subsequent work of Marie and Pierre Curie opened new frontiers. Ernest Rutherford’s gold foil experiment, which revealed the nucleus of an atom, was pivotal. Early developments in nuclear decay laws and the identification of radiation types owe much to classical methodologies.</div>
