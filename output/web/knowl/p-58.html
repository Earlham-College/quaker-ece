<em class="alert">Dot Product / Inner Product:</em> The dot product (more generally known as the <dfn class="terminology">inner product</dfn> in the context of quantum computation) is an operation between two vectors of the same dimension that produces a scalar. This product is typically referred to with a <span class="process-math">\(\cdot\text{,}\)</span> but has an alternate notation in quantum computation that we will see in the next section. In <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> and In <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{C}^n\)</span> this operation is performed by taking the sum of the products of the corresponding entries in each vector, as shown below.</div>
=======
<em class="alert">Vector Transpose:</em> The <dfn class="terminology">transpose</dfn> is an operation that turns a standard column vector into a row vector, or vice versa. This means an <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> dimensional vector changes from having <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> rows and <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> column to having <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> row and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> columns. The transpose is represented with a superscript <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> and the operation is shown below.</div>
