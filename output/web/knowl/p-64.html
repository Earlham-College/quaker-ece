<em class="alert">Normality:</em> A vector is <dfn class="terminology">normal</dfn> if it has a length of <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> The length (sometimes also referred to as the norm) of a vector can be found be taking the square root of the sum of the squares of its entries, as shown below. This operation is represented by lines(<span class="process-math">\(\| \ \|\)</span>) on either side of the vector that is having its length found. A non-normal vector can be normalized by dividing each of its components by the vectors length. A normalized vector has the same direction as the original vector, but has a length of <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> A set of vectors is <dfn class="terminology">orthonormal</dfn> if each of the vectors are normal and each of the vectors are orthogonal to the rest.</div>
