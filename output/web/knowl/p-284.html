<div class="para">Notice that after 4 values of <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> the function <span class="process-math">\(g_{229,247}(r)\)</span> begins to repeat itself. If we continued to write out this sequence as <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> continues to increase, we would find that every 4 integers, the sequence repeats again. This means that <span class="process-math">\(g_{229,247}(r)\)</span> has a period of 4, which means <span class="process-math">\(g_{229,247}(r) = g_{229,247}(r+4)\text{.}\)</span>
