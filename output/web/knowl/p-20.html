<div class="para">Nuclear physics, focusing on atomic nuclei, emerged in the early 20th century, building on classical foundations. The discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel and the subsequent work of Marie and Pierre Curie opened new frontiers. Ernest Rutherford’s gold foil experiment, which revealed the nucleus of an atom, was pivotal. Early developments in nuclear decay laws and the identification of radiation types owe much to classical methodologies.</div>

<div class="para">Electromagnetism, dealing with electric and magnetic fields and their interactions, began in the 18th century with static electricity and magnetism as separate phenomena. Benjamin Franklin’s experiments with lightning and Luigi Galvani’s work on bioelectricity were early milestones. The unification of electricity and magnetism into a single theory was achieved by James Clerk Maxwell in the mid-19th century, whose equations predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves, leading to Heinrich Hertz’s discovery of radio waves.</div>
