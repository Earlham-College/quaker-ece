<em class="alert">Born Rule:</em> The Born Rule tells us that if we express a qubit as a linear combination of basis states, then upon measurement, the probability that the qubit collapses into any given basis state is equal to the square of the coefficient for that basis state. A qubit <span class="process-math">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span> in a vector space defined by the basis <span class="process-math">\(\{ \ket{\beta_1},\ket{\beta_2},\ldots,\ket{\beta_n} \} \)</span>
=======
<div class="para">Since all qubits are normalized, <span class="process-math">\(\psi\)</span> has a length of <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{\alpha^2 + \beta^2}=1\text{,}\)</span> which means <span class="process-math">\(\alpha^2 + \beta^2=1\text{.}\)</span>  Since the combined probability that the qubit will be in the state <span class="process-math">\(\ket{0}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\ket{1}\)</span> is equal to <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> we use the normal property of qubits as a method to determine the probability that the qubit will be in either state. For the qubit <span class="process-math">\(\psi\)</span> the probability that it will be in the state <span class="process-math">\(\ket{0}\)</span> after it is measured is <span class="process-math">\(\alpha^2\)</span> and the probability that it will be in the state <span class="process-math">\(\ket{1}\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\beta^2\text{.}\)</span>
