<em class="alert">Matrix Addition:</em> Two matrices can be added together only if they each have the same number of rows and columns. The sum of two matrices is found by adding together the corresponding entries of each matrix, as shown below with an example of two <span class="process-math">\(3\times3\)</span> matrices.</div>
=======
<div class="para">The concept of a transpose can be extended from vectors to matrices as well. A matrixâ€™s transpose is found by turning each of its rows into a column, or, equivalently, by turning each of its columns into a row. This means the transpose of an <span class="process-math">\(m \times n\)</span> matrix is an <span class="process-math">\(n \times m\)</span> matrix. The matrix transpose is also represented by a superscript <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span> An example of transposing a <span class="process-math">\(3 \times 3\)</span> matrix is shown below.</div>
