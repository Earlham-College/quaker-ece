<div class="para">Newton’s first law, put simply, is that in the absence of external forces, an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion. Furthermore, without outside interference, an object in motion will travel at a constant speed in a straight line. In Principia, Newton defines inertia as the property of matter to preserve its current state and resist attempts to change it.  Thus, the first law of motion establishes that all objects have the property of inertia and resist changes to their state of rest or motion.</div>

<div class="para">Many of the concepts behind Classical Physics are motivated by Newtonian Mechanics, which is derived from Newton’s three laws of motion. These laws provide a framework for determining how an object will move when acted upon (or not acted upon) by external forces. Newton’s three laws were first described in his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which is widely considered to be one of the most important works in the history of physics. </div>
