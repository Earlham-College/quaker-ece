<div class="para">Many of the concepts behind Classical Physics are motivated by Newtonian Mechanics, which is derived from Newton’s three laws of motion. These laws provide a framework for determining how an object will move when acted upon (or not acted upon) by external forces. Newton’s three laws were first described in his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which is widely considered to be one of the most important works in the history of physics. </div>
