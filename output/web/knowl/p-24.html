<div class="para">Many of the concepts behind Classical Physics are motivated by Newtonian Mechanics, which is derived from Newton’s three laws of motion. These laws provide a framework for determining how an object will move when acted upon (or not acted upon) by external forces. Newton’s three laws were first described in his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which is widely considered to be one of the most important works in the history of physics. </div>

<div class="para">Classical physics is crucial academically as it forms the foundational bedrock upon which modern physics and other scientific disciplines are built. It introduces students to fundamental concepts such as Newtonian mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism, cultivating critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Mastery of classical physics fosters an appreciation for the scientific method and the historical context of discoveries, illustrating the interplay of theoretical advances and experimental validations. Serving as an indispensable educational foundation, classical physics equips students with the knowledge and skills necessary for careers in science, engineering, and technology, continuing to inspire future innovations and discoveries.</div>
