<div class="para">Physics is about motion, atoms, nuclei, elementary particles, heat, Thermodynamics, Electrodynamics, and Statistics, among other areas. These many different fields can be classified by their mathematical concepts, their chronological development, or even in terms of theoretical and experimental scientific points of view.</div>
=======
<div class="para">In this chapter, we shall discuss physics and its role in <dfn class="terminology">quantum computing</dfn> . It will be particularly relevant for people who think the study of physics and mathematics is nothing more than a list of equations to memorize for any undergraduate student enrolled in sciences. This is untrue. Science evolves every day and the job of a scientist is to synthesize their knowledge to face problems and find solutions. Since physics is relevant to many different domains in science, it is a multifaceted subject that is highly important to study.</div>
