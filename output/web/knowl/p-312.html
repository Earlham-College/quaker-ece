<div class="para">When <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is even, we know that <span class="process-math">\(N | (a^{r/2}-1)(a^{r/2}+1)\text{.}\)</span> It cannot be the case that <span class="process-math">\(N | a^{r/2}-1\)</span> because this would imply that <span class="process-math">\(a^{r/2} = 1 \text{ mod } N\)</span> which cannot be true since <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is the smallest value that satisfies that equation. If we can show that it is also not the case that <span class="process-math">\(N | a^{r/2}+1\text{,}\)</span> then we will know that <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="process-math">\((a^{r/2}+1)(a^{r/2}-1)\)</span> but that <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is not a multiple of <span class="process-math">\(a^{r/2}+1\)</span> nor of <span class="process-math">\(a^{r/2}-1\text{.}\)</span> This means that <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> must share common factors with <span class="process-math">\(a^{r/2}+1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a^{r/2}-1\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">This tells us that the period of the function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> will be the smallest nonzero value of <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> that satisfies the equation <span class="process-math">\((a^{r/2}+1)(a^{r/2}-1)=0 \text{ mod } N\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is even, then <span class="process-math">\(a^{r/2}+1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a^{r/2}-1\)</span> are guaranteed to be integers. Since we are looking to find integer factors, if we want to factor <span class="process-math">\(N\text{,}\)</span> then we must keep choosing values of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> until <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is an even number.</div>
