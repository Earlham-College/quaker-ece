<div class="para">Now that we know matrix multiplication, we can redefine the dot product / inner product as the transpose of a vector multiplied by the original vector. Since vectors are <span class="process-math">\(n \times 1\)</span> dimensional, the transpose will be <span class="process-math">\(1 \times n\)</span> dimensional, so multiplying the transpose on the left and the original on the right will produce a <span class="process-math">\(1 \times 1\)</span> matrix, which is functionally the same as a scalar.</div>

<div class="para">
<em class="alert">Matrix Multiplication:</em> Two matrices can be multiplied together only if the number of columns of the left matrix is equal to the number of rows of the right matrix. The resulting product will be a matrix with the same number of rows as the left matrix and the same number of columns as the right. Thus an <span class="process-math">\(m /times n\)</span> matrix multiplied by a <span class="process-math">\(n \times q\)</span> matrix would produce an <span class="process-math">\(m \times q\)</span> matrix. Notably, matrix multiplication is non-commutative, which means for two matrices <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(AB \neq BA\text{.}\)</span> The entries of a product matrix are determined by taking the dot product between the corresponding row of the left matrix and the corresponding column of the right matrix, as shown below with an example of multiplication between a <span class="process-math">\(3\times3\)</span> and a <span class="process-math">\(3\times2\)</span> matrix.</div>
