<div class="para">Grover’s algorithm, developed by Lov Grover in 1996, provides a quadratic speedup for unsorted database searches. In classical computing, searching an unsorted database of <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> items requires <span class="process-math">\(O(N)\)</span>  time, whereas Grover’s algorithm can achieve this in <span class="process-math">\(O(\sqrt{N})\)</span> time. This is achieved by exploiting the principles of superposition and amplitude amplification, allowing the quantum computer to evaluate multiple possibilities simultaneously. Grover’s algorithm has broad implications for fields requiring extensive search capabilities, such as cryptography and database management.</div>

<div class="para">In general, algorithms are step-by-step procedures that take an input, process it through a series of well-defined steps, and produce an output. They are the backbone of problem-solving in computing, enabling machines to perform tasks efficiently and systematically. Quantum computing introduces a new paradigm in algorithm design, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers. Two of the most prominent quantum algorithms are Grover’s algorithm and Shor’s algorithm, each demonstrating the transformative potential of quantum computing.</div>
