<div class="para">Algorithms are fundamental to computing, guiding processes and solving problems efficiently. Quantum algorithms harness the unique properties of quantum mechanics to tackle challenges beyond the reach of classical algorithms. These developments not only demonstrate the power of quantum computing but also herald a new era of computational possibilities, revolutionizing fields from cryptography to data search. In this chapter, we will discuss the basic concepts and process of Grover’s and Shor’s algorithms.</div>
=======
<div class="para">Shor’s algorithm, proposed by Peter Shor in 1994, addresses the problem of integer factorization, which underpins the security of many classical cryptographic systems, such as RSA. Classical algorithms for factoring large integers are inefficient, making RSA encryption secure under current classical computing capabilities. However, Shor’s algorithm can factorize large integers exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms, in polynomial time. This breakthrough poses a significant threat to current cryptographic practices, necessitating the development of quantum-resistant encryption methods.</div>
