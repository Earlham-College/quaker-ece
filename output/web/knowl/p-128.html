<div class="para">The Bloch sphere is called a projective sphere because the states of our quantum system are rays in the Hilbert space<span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{H}\text{,}\)</span> and we would prefer to visualize vectors as points, not rays. Going back to the underlying <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{C}^{n}\)</span> we collapse the ray that represents a quantum state onto the surface of an <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-dimensional sphere. We are projecting all those representatives onto a single point on the complex n-sphere. Notice that each point on that sphere still has infinitely many representations impossible to picture due to the potential scalar factor <span class="process-math">\(e^{i \gamma}\text{,}\)</span> that we left out of our equation.</div>
