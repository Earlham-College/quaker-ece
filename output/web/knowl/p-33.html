<div class="para">Every vector exists within a <dfn class="terminology">vector space</dfn>, which are sets that satisfy certain mathematical properties. The most common vector spaces we will deal with are <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^n\text{,}\)</span> the set of all <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> dimensional vectors with real components, and <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{C}^n\text{,}\)</span> the set of all <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> dimensional vectors with complex components. Notice <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^n \subseteq \mathbb{C}^n\text{,}\)</span> so we will usually work with <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{C}^n\)</span> for generality. All vector spaces have the same properties regardless of dimension. Here are the properties for an <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-dimensional vector space:</div>
=======
<div class="para">The most typical use of a vector with <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> components is to describe a point in <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> dimensional space in reference to some starting point. For example, if you have a square piece of paper and label the bottom left corner with the starting point (0,0), then a vector with components (1,1) would represent moving one unit of measurement along the bottom of the paper and one unit of measurement along the side of the paper to reach a new point. This vector would have a direction of <span class="process-math">\(45^{\circ}\)</span> and a magnitude of <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> units (by the pythagorean theorem).</div>
