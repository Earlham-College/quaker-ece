<div class="para">In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler elucidated the principles of lenses and vision, while Galileo’s telescopic observations expanded our understanding of the cosmos. Isaac Newton’s corpuscular theory of light and Christian Huygens’ wave theory were significant milestones, reconciled in the 19th century by experiments demonstrating the wave nature of light.</div>

<div class="para">Classical physics, a cornerstone of scientific understanding, encompasses several branches that describe the physical phenomena of the universe, laying the groundwork for modern science.  Optics, electromagnetism, nuclear physics, astrophysics, and thermodynamics are pivotal fields that have evolved through centuries of inquiry and discovery. Optics, the study of light and its interactions with matter, dates back to ancient civilizations. The Greeks, particularly Euclid and Ptolemy, made early contributions with theories on reflection and refraction.</div>
