<div class="para">A vector is an ordered list of numbers that is used to describe quantities with both magnitude and direction. One example of a vector is force, which has both a magnitude (how strong the force is) and a direction (the angle at which the force is being applied). Each vector has a dimension, which is the number of components that comprise it. It is customary to signify that something is a vector by either drawing an arrow on top of it or bolding it. If we have a vector called <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> we would write <span class="process-math">\(\vec{x}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\boldsymbol{x}\text{.}\)</span> The number <span class="process-math">\(x_{n}\)</span> is called the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-th component of <span class="process-math">\(\vec{x}\text{.}\)</span>
