=======
<div class="para">The security behind our modern cryptographic methods lies in the fact that it is very computationally difficult to find the prime factors of large numbers. It takes years of computing time on a classical computer to find the factors of numbers with hundreds of digits. The algorithm designed by Peter Shor takes advantage of quantum concepts to find the prime factors of large numbers much quicker. If a powerful enough quantum computer is ever built it could be used to break most modern encryptions jarringly quickly. Before describing the algorithm, we must first define some terms.</div>
